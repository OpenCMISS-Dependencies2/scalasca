Google C++ Testing Framework
============================

This directory contains a stripped-down but otherwise unmodified copy of
the Google C++ Testing Framework v1.7.0 (with all files using the common
"gtest" file name prefix).  For more details, documentation, and download
of a full distribution package see

    http://code.google.com/p/googletest/


Extensions
==========

Besides the source code of the Google C++ Testing Framework itself, some
custom extensions are provided -- mainly to address HPC-specific needs.
The corresponding files all use the "ext" file name prefix to distinguish
them from the files provided by the original framework.
