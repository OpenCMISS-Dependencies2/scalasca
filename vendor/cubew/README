                           ===============================

Cube Writer Library is a high-performance library for writing a multi-
dimensional performance space consisting of the dimensions (i) performance 
metric, (ii) call path, and (iii) system resource. Each dimension can be 
represented as a tree, where non-leaf nodes of the tree can be collapsed 
or expanded to achieve the desired level of granularity. 

The Cube Writer Library is optimized for usage in Score-P and Scalasca 2.x, but 
might get used in another tools as well. 

Cube Writer Library is released as open source under a BSD-style license. 
Please see the COPYING file in the package base directory for details.
