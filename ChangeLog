------------------- Released version 2.6 -----------------------------

 * Build system improvements:
    - Auto-detect Cray XC platforms with ARM CPUs, supporting Cray,
      ARM, and GCC compilers
    - Added support for Clang and AMD AOCC compilers
    - Updated support for Spectrum MPI

 * Automatic trace analyzer changes & improvements:
    - Revised "Early Reduce" wait state definition.
    - Added calculation of "Early Reduce" delay costs.
    - Fixed various delay cost calculation and propagation issues.
    - Fixed various inconsistencies between wait-state and root-cause
      analysis.
    - Made POSIX threads analysis consistent with Score-P by avoiding
      thread function stub call paths underneath 'pthread_create'.
      This also fixes a deadlock when analyzing traces containing
      "orphaned threads".

 * Measurement nexus (scan) changes:
    - Added preset mode for multi-run measurements with a preset for
      POP analysis requirements as an use case.
    - Added support for multiple file systems in SCAN_TRACE_FILESYS
      by using a colon separated list of paths.

 * Analysis report postprocessing changes:
    - Add metric hierarchies for CUDA, OpenCL, and OpenACC.
      (NOTE: The trace analysis still only supports host-side events!)
    - Renamed '-c' command-line option of 'square' to '-C' for running
      sanity checks on newly created reports.
    - Added new '-c' command-line option to 'square' to allow specifying
      the number of counters considered during report scoring (for
      consistency with 'scorep-score').
    - Added new '-x' command-line option to 'square' to allow passing
      options directly through to 'scorep-score'.
    - Avoid unnecessary aggregation/postprocessing of reports with
      multi-run experiments.

 * Substantial code cleanup.
